## About this project

A few months ago the Security+ exam was updated and I wanted to review concepts from the past as well as see what's new in the industry.  I am Securty+ certified and I do my best to keep up with all aspects of Information Technology

From a web development standpoint, this was another opportunity to apply the skills I've learned since I did the A+ [901](https://codepen.io/xmtrinidad/full/QMpKpQ/) and [902](https://xmtrinidad.github.io/aplus902/) objectives a few months ago.  With this project, I used Angular.  In the past, I didn't feel confident in my ability to use it in a project, but now that I have improved, it was a viable option in order to complete this project.
